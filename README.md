# thanexor's simple framework

This framework includes:

* Basic content formatting (headings, paragraphs, quotes, tables, etc.)
* Frankenstein'd boilerplate CSS with elements taken from [Normalize.css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css) and [HTML5 BP](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate)
* Percentage-based grid system, some ideas from [Nicole Sullivan](www.stubbornella.org/)
* Fancy default form styles, with helper classes for common patterns
* 'Media box' classes, which are used for graphics with associated text
* jQuery and UI
* Improved 'IE classes' on HTML (eg. ie-lt9 targets IE 6 and 7, instead of having to do .ie6,.ie7)
